# Security & Privacy Guide

## Account Security

### How do I create a strong password?

Create a secure password with:

**Requirements**:
- Minimum 8 characters (12+ recommended)
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)

**Best Practices**:
- Never reuse passwords across sites
- Use a password manager (LastPass, 1Password, Bitwarden)
- Avoid dictionary words, names, or dates
- Change password if compromised
- Don't share your password with anyone

**Examples of Strong Passwords**:
- `Tr0p!cal$unset2024`
- `Blu3M00n#Skyline`
- `Quantum*Jump&7`

**Weak Passwords to Avoid**:
- password123
- YourName2024
- qwerty
- 12345678

### What is two-factor authentication and why should I use it?

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra security layer:

**How It Works**:
1. Enter your password (something you know)
2. Enter a code from your phone (something you have)
3. Both required to access your account

**Benefits**:
- Blocks 99.9% of account hacking attempts
- Protects even if password is stolen
- Required for Enterprise accounts
- Recommended for all users

**2FA Methods We Support**:
- **Authenticator Apps** (recommended): Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator
- **SMS codes**: Sent to your phone number
- **Backup codes**: Use if device unavailable

**How to Enable**:
1. Settings > Security > Two-Factor Authentication
2. Choose your method
3. Follow setup instructions
4. Save backup codes safely

### How do I recognize phishing attempts?

Protect yourself from phishing scams:

**Red Flags**:
- Urgent requests for password or payment info
- Suspicious sender email (e.g., examp1e.com instead of example.com)
- Generic greetings ("Dear Customer" instead of your name)
- Spelling and grammar errors
- Threats or pressure tactics
- Links to suspicious websites

**Our Official Channels**:
- Email: Always from @example.com domain
- Website: Always https://example.com (note the 's')
- Phone: +1-800-EXAMPLE only
- We'll NEVER ask for your password via email
- We'll NEVER ask for credit card details via email

**If You Receive a Suspicious Email**:
1. Don't click links or download attachments
2. Don't reply or provide information
3. Forward to phishing@example.com
4. Delete the email
5. Change your password if you clicked anything

**Report Phishing**:
Email phishing@example.com with:
- Forward the suspicious email
- Include full headers if possible
- We'll investigate within 24 hours

### What should I do if my account is compromised?

If you suspect unauthorized access:

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Change your password immediately
2. Enable two-factor authentication
3. Review recent account activity (Settings > Security > Activity Log)
4. Check for unrecognized devices (Settings > Security > Active Sessions)
5. Log out all other sessions
6. Review and update security questions

**Contact Support**:
- Email security@example.com
- Use "My account was hacked" subject line
- Provide details of suspicious activity
- We'll investigate and help secure your account

**Check For**:
- Unauthorized purchases or subscription changes
- Messages sent from your account
- Changed email or password
- New linked devices
- Modified settings

**Prevention**:
- Use unique, strong password
- Enable 2FA
- Don't use public Wi-Fi for sensitive actions
- Keep recovery email updated
- Regularly review account activity

### How do I secure my account when using public Wi-Fi?

Public Wi-Fi is risky - follow these precautions:

**Risks**:
- Hackers can intercept data
- Fake "free Wi-Fi" networks
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Malware distribution

**Best Practices**:
1. **Use VPN**: Encrypts your connection
   - Recommended: NordVPN, ExpressVPN, ProtonVPN
2. **Check HTTPS**: Ensure URL shows padlock icon
3. **Disable auto-connect**: Don't connect automatically to Wi-Fi
4. **Use mobile data**: For sensitive transactions
5. **Avoid**:
   - Banking or payments on public Wi-Fi
   - Accessing sensitive data
   - Networks without passwords

**After Using Public Wi-Fi**:
- Clear browser cache
- Change passwords
- Run antivirus scan
- Check account activity

**Safer Alternatives**:
- Use your phone's hotspot
- Use mobile data
- Wait until secure network available

### What are security questions and how do I set them up?

Security questions help verify your identity:

**Purpose**:
- Account recovery if you forget password
- Verify identity for sensitive changes
- Additional security layer

**How to Set Up**:
1. Settings > Security > Security Questions
2. Choose 3 questions from list
3. Provide answers
4. Save securely

**Choosing Questions**:
- Pick questions only you know the answer to
- Avoid answers easily found on social media
- Don't use obvious answers

**Example Questions**:
- What was the name of your first pet?
- What city were you born in?
- What was your childhood nickname?
- What is your favorite book?

**Answer Tips**:
- Add complexity: "Fluffy" → "Fluffy2019!"
- Use memorable but not obvious answers
- Write answers in consistent format (capitalization)
- Store answers securely in password manager

**Never**:
- Share your security answers
- Use same answers across sites
- Use easily guessable answers
